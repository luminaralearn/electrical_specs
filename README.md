‚ö° EV Charger System Calculator

A Streamlit app designed to support planning and sizing of EV charging infrastructure in accordance with Australian Standards (AS/NZS 3000, 3008, 60947.2, 60898, 3439.1, and 60076).

üîß Features
	‚Ä¢	Charger Config Input: Add AC (7kW/22kW) or DC (25‚Äì350kW) chargers
	‚Ä¢	Standards-Based Calculations:
	‚Ä¢	Breaker sizing
	‚Ä¢	Cable sizing based on AS/NZS 3008
	‚Ä¢	Derating using safety factors
	‚Ä¢	Main Switchboard (MSB) Sizing:
	‚Ä¢	Diversified load calculation
	‚Ä¢	Main breaker and busbar rating
	‚Ä¢	MSB dimensions based on common configurations
	‚Ä¢	Visual SLD Generation:
	‚Ä¢	Auto-generates Single Line Diagram (SLD) for all charger configurations
	‚Ä¢	Session State Memory: Keeps user inputs intact across app interactions

üìò How it Works
	1.	Add Chargers: Select type (AC/DC), size (kW), and quantity.
	2.	Calculator Engine:
	‚Ä¢	Computes current draw
	‚Ä¢	Applies safety and diversity factors
	‚Ä¢	Selects breakers and cables using AS/NZS standard values
	3.	MSB Sizing:
	‚Ä¢	Aggregates charger loads
	‚Ä¢	Applies diversity
	‚Ä¢	Selects MSB based on available configurations
	4.	SLD Visualisation:
	‚Ä¢	Renders a diagram using graphviz showing the transformer, MSB, breakers, and chargers
	‚Ä¢	Includes cable specs and relevant AS/NZS clauses

üìê Customisable Parameters

Available in the Calculation Parameters panel:
	‚Ä¢	Safety factor
	‚Ä¢	Diversity factor
	‚Ä¢	Charger efficiency (DC)
	‚Ä¢	Power factor
	‚Ä¢	AC & DC system voltages
